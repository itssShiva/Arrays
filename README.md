# 📚 Array Problem Solutions

This repository contains a curated collection of **array-related problem solutions** implemented in various programming languages (like C++, JavaScript, etc.). These problems are focused on improving understanding of arrays, their patterns, and common algorithmic techniques used in coding interviews and competitive programming.

## 🚀 What's Inside

- ✅ Basic array operations
- 🔁 Searching and sorting techniques
- 🔄 Sliding window problems
- ⚖️ Two-pointer approaches
- 🧠 Hashing & frequency counting
- 🔢 Prefix sums and difference arrays
- 📊 Subarrays and their properties
- 🔁 Rotations and cyclic shifts
- ❓ Miscellaneous tricky and edge-case problems

> You can modify the structure to match your organization — for example, by platform (`leetcode/`, `gfg/`, `custom/`) or language (`cpp/`, `js/`, etc.).

## 🧠 Problem Sources

Problems are taken from various popular coding platforms such as:
- Leetcode
- GeeksforGeeks
- CodeStudio
- Custom practice questions

> All solutions are written from scratch with clear logic and comments for better understanding.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Browse through the folders (easy, medium, hard).
2. Open any `.cpp` file to view the solution.
3. Run the code in your preferred IDE or online compiler.
4. Refer to the comments to understand the approach and complexity.

## ✍️ Author's Note
